As part of this service, Google Adwords sets a cookie on your computer ("conversion cookie") if you have come to our website via a Google ad. These types of cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used to identify you personally. If you visit certain pages of ours and if the cookie has not yet expired, it is possible for us and Google to recognize with the help of this cookie that someone clicked on the ad and was thus redirected to our site. Since each AdWords customer receives a different cookie, it is not possible to track the cookie across other AdWords customers' websites. The purpose of the conversion cookie is to use the information collected to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers. As an AdWords customer, we only learn the total number of users who clicked on our ad and were redirected to a page tagged with a conversion tracking tag. However, we do not receive any information that allows us to personally identify a user.

The videos are stored on http://www.YouTube.com. You can play these videos directly from our website. The videos are all embedded in "enhanced privacy mode", which means that no data about you as a user is stored by YouTube unless you play the videos. Nevertheless, YouTube contacts the Google service Double Click, whereby, according to YouTube, no data is stored in this case. Only when you play the videos will your IP address and the information that you have watched the video be stored by YouTube. If you are logged in to YouTube, this information is also assigned to your user account with YouTube. If you do not wish this, you must log out of your YouTube account before playing the video. We have no influence on the data collection and processing by YouTube. You can find more information about the data processing by YouTube in their privacy policy.

                                <br>
                                <br>By a personal customer profile we mean a database consisting of the following data:
                                <br>1. Data that is collected when you use our digital offers with regard to your online usage behaviour.
                                <br>
                                <br>By this we mean data that is collected when you visit our website and our social media presences, when you use one of our apps and when you receive our newsletter or push messages. In detail, this is, for example, information about which pages you view, when and for how long you visit us or use our apps, whether you read our newsletters and which end devices you use for this purpose. You can find out which data is collected in detail and on what legal basis within the scope of the respective digital offer in the data protection information of the respective digital offer.
                                <br>
                                <br>2. Customer and contract-related data
                                <br>
                                <br>By this we mean data that we have received from you as part of a pre-contractual or contractual relationship. This includes, for example, your name, contact details, contractual details such as your tariff and your consumption and also technical or construction data if it was collected as part of our (pre-)contractual relationship (e.g. roof area, system performance data).
                                <br>
                                <br>3. Other information provided
                                <br>
                                <br>By this we mean all data that you have given us yourself or generated by means of our applications outside of our contractual or pre-contractual relationship. This can be, for example, your expressed interest in one of our products or services, but also, for example, a notice of an upcoming move or other changes to your home, which could have an impact on the optimal tariff for you. Another example is when you use our e-mobility driving simulation to find out whether an e-car could be useful for you.
                                <br>
                                <br>4. Data that we collect in the context of your communication with us.
                                <br>
                                <br>We understand this to mean data that we collect in connection with a communication with you in addition to the information provided in terms of content. This concerns in particular our assessment of your satisfaction.
                                <br>
                                <br>If you have given your consent to the creation of a personal customer profile, this data will be merged and evaluated on a personal basis. The creation of your personal customer profile serves the purpose that we can refer you to content individually tailored to your interests, where we assume that they could be particularly helpful or interesting for you in your situation. It also allows us to provide you with more relevant offers that are more likely to be of interest to you. Furthermore, with the help of the customer profile, we can offer advice that meets your personal needs and give you more transparency around your energy consumption and costs and help you avoid unnecessary consumption.
                                <br>
                                <br>The legal basis for the data processing is your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 a) DSGVO). The personal customer profile created will be deleted when it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was created, but at the latest when you withdraw your consent.
                                <br>Please note that the granting/non-granting of consent does not affect data processing that is already permitted on the basis of other legal grounds (such as for contractual purposes (Art. 6(1)(b)) or for legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) DSGVO)).

                                <br>On our website we have integrated so-called news feeds of social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+. When you visit our website, these news feeds are deactivated by default. This means that without activating the news feeds on your part, no data is sent to the respective social networks. To activate the newsfeeds, you must first click on them. The newsfeed will then remain activated until the browser window is closed. As soon as you have activated the respective newsfeed, a direct connection is established with the server of the respective social network, whereby the content of the newsfeed is transmitted to your browser and integrated by it into the displayed website. Through the activation, the information that you have visited our website is transmitted to the operator of the respective social network. If you are logged into the respective social network via your personal user account during your visit to our website, the social network can assign the website visit to your account. This applies regardless of whether you actually use the newsfeed after activation. By interacting with the newsfeed, e.g. by leaving a comment, this corresponding information is transmitted directly to the respective social network and stored there. The legal basis for the data transmission to the respective social network is your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 a) DSGVO), which you give by activating the respective newsfeed. We would like to point out that we have no influence on the scope of the data collected by the social networks by means of the news feeds. The scope and the purposes of data processing pursued by the social networks as well as your rights in this regard and setting options for protecting your privacy can be found in the data protection notices of the respective social networks.
